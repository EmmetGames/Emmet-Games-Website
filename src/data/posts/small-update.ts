  content: `Hi everyone, long time no see! I just wanted to give you a small update on how things are going, and to let you know about some exciting stuff!

Even though these are troubled times, personally I've been holding up pretty well. My new job as a full-time Unity developer is lots of fun, and I'm learning lots of new things every day. I can almost _feel_ how I'm becoming a better game developer by just being there and absorbing information and good habits :)

But enough of that boring stuff, let's get to the fun stuff!

### New Game

That's right! I'm actually working on a new indie game!
Going back to my roots, this is a 100% free, no monetization game for mobile devices. I don't want to spoil too much, but it is a meta-game - that is, a game where its existence is more of a game than the actual game itself. On top of that, it's a satire/joke game. Honestly, the game is mostly complete, and I'm really looking forward to releasing it soon :)

What could it be about?

### Support Drop for _Meme Masters_

To clarify - _Meme Masters_ is still playable! Just with less servers.
Still, it is with a heavy heart that I inform you that I will no longer support the extensive multiplayer servers of Meme Masters. From now on, only up to 10 players will be able to play the game at the same time. Simply put, the server costs were no longer worth the trouble, considering this is an older game now that basically nobody plays. Let's hope that in the future I'll be able to repurpose this money for more fun experiences :)

That's it for now. I promise I have some really interesting topics to bring up in the future, so stay tuned if you wanna learn some nifty game-dev stuff!`,
