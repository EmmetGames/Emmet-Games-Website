Warning - playing the game may turn you into a meme yourself

In all seriousness, I cannot thank my friends and my brother enough for their help and contributions throughout the making of this game. Their suggestions and feedback was always constructive and helped improve the game every step of the way. Without them, this game wouldn't be half as good, and it fills me with tremendous pride whenever one of them plays this game and has a blast doing it.

Seriously, you guys (and gals) rock. You make game development all worth it.

_Meme Masters_ may be released, but I still have a whole bunch of features down the pipeline, and I hope the first expansion update for the game wouldn't be too far from now.
I don't want to spoil everything regarding the update I'm working on... but expect to be playing against more than just your friends in the upcoming months :)

That's it for now. Please check out the game and rate it/review it on the Play store if you can!
See you!`,
